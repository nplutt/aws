General EC2 Notes
========================
- EC2s are virtual machines for the cloud

Options
========================
- On demand: allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
             (billed by the second)
- Reserved instances: provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers 
                      a significant discount to the hourly charge. (1 - 3 yrs)
- Spot: enable you to bid what ever price you want for instance capacity, 
        providing for even greater savings if your apps have flexible start
        and end times.
- Dedicated hosts: physical hosts dedicates for your use. Help wby reducing
                   costs for licenses.

When to Use Options
========================
- On Demand
    * Users want lowest cost and most flexible option
    * Applications with short spikey loads
    * Applications in newer phases of development
- Reserved
    * Steady state and predictable usage
    * Applications require reserved instances
    * Users able to make upfront payments ro reduce total compute costs
- Spot
    * Applications that have flexible start and end times
    * Applications that can only use very low compute prices
    * Users with urgent computing needs or computing capacity
- Dedicated hosts
    * Useful for regulatory requirements
    * If licensing doesn't support multi-tenancy
    * Purchased on demand
    * Can be purchased through reservation

Instance Types
========================
D2: Dense storage; Fileservers/data warehousing/hadoop
R4: Memory optimized; Memory intensive apps/DBs
M4: General purpose; application servers
C4: Compute optimized; CPU intensive apps/DBs
G2: Graphics intensive; Video encoding/3D application streaming
I2: High speed storage; NoSql DBs/Data warehousing
F1: Field porgrammable gate array; Hardware acceleration for your code
T2: Lowest cost, general purpose; Web servers/small DBs
P2: Graphics/General purpose GPU; machine learning
X1: Memory optimized; SAP HANA/Apache Spark etc.


General EBS Notes
========================
EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances.
Once attached you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a
database, or use them in any other way you want. EBS volumes are places in
a specific AZ where they are automatically replicated to protect you from 
the failure of a single component.

Volume Types
========================
- Genreal purpose SSD:
    * Balance of both price and performance
    * Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the availability to
      burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at
      3334 Gib and above
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
    * Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or 
      NoSql Databases
    * Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
    * Can go up to 20,000 IOPS
- Throughput Optimized HDD
    * Big Data
    * Data warehouses
    * Log processing
    * Cannot be boot volumes (cannot boot from these drives)
- Cold HDD
    * Lowest cost storage for infrequent accessed workloads
    * File servers
    * Cannot be boot volumes
- Magnetic Standard
    * Lowest cost bootable EBS volume type
