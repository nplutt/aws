General
========================
- Virtual firewall that controls traffic to your instances. It is your
  first line of defense against hackers and malicious users.
- Security group rule changes take effect immediately
- Inbound rules are automatically added to the outbound rules as well.
  (Even though they will not appear in the list)
- Instances can have multiple security groups attached to themselves
- All inbound traffic is blocked by defualt
- All outbound traffic is allowed
- Securtiy groups are stateful
    * If you create an inbound ruke allowing traffic in, that traffic
      automatically allowed back out again.
- You can specify allow rules not deny rules.
