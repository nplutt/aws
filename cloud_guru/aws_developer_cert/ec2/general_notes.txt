General EC2 Notes
========================
- EC2s are virtual machines for the cloud

Options
========================
- On demand: allows you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
             (billed by the second)
- Reserved instances: provides you with a capacity reservation, and offers 
                      a significant discount to the hourly charge. (1 - 3 yrs)
- Spot: enable you to bid what ever price you want for instance capacity, 
        providing for even greater savings if your apps have flexible start
        and end times.
- Dedicated hosts: physical hosts dedicates for your use. Help wby reducing
                   costs for licenses.

When to Use Options
========================
- On Demand
    * Users want lowest cost and most flexible option
    * Applications with short spikey loads
    * Applications in newer phases of development
- Reserved
    * Steady state and predictable usage
    * Applications require reserved instances
    * Users able to make upfront payments ro reduce total compute costs
- Spot
    * Applications that have flexible start and end times
    * Applications that can only use very low compute prices
    * Users with urgent computing needs or computing capacity
- Dedicated hosts
    * Useful for regulatory requirements
    * If licensing doesn't support multi-tenancy
    * Purchased on demand
    * Can be purchased through reservation

Instance Types
========================
D2: Dense storage; Fileservers/data warehousing/hadoop
R4: Memory optimized; Memory intensive apps/DBs
M4: General purpose; application servers
C4: Compute optimized; CPU intensive apps/DBs
G2: Graphics intensive; Video encoding/3D application streaming
I2: High speed storage; NoSql DBs/Data warehousing
F1: Field porgrammable gate array; Hardware acceleration for your code
T2: Lowest cost, general purpose; Web servers/small DBs
P2: Graphics/General purpose GPU; machine learning
X1: Memory optimized; SAP HANA/Apache Spark etc.


General EBS Notes
========================
EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to EC2 instances.
Once attached you can create a file system on top of these volumes, run a
database, or use them in any other way you want. EBS volumes are places in
a specific AZ where they are automatically replicated to protect you from 
the failure of a single component.

Volume Types
========================
- Genreal purpose SSD:
    * Balance of both price and performance
    * Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the availability to
      burst up to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes at
      3334 Gib and above
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1)
    * Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or 
      NoSql Databases
    * Use if you need more than 10,000 IOPS
    * Can go up to 20,000 IOPS
- Throughput Optimized HDD
    * Big Data
    * Data warehouses
    * Log processing
    * Cannot be boot volumes (cannot boot from these drives)
- Cold HDD
    * Lowest cost storage for infrequent accessed workloads
    * File servers
    * Cannot be boot volumes
- Magnetic Standard
    * Lowest cost bootable EBS volume type

Encrypted Volume Notes
========================
Can't encrypt root volumes by default, can encrypt all additional volumes though.

EC2 Lab Summary
========================
- Termination protection is turned off by default
- On EBS backed instance the default action is for the root ebs volume to be 
  deleted when the isnatce is terminated.
- EBS root volumes of your default AMI cannot be encrypted. You can use 3rd party
  tools to encrypt the root volume, or this can be done when creating an AMI in
  the aws console or API.
- Additional volumes can be encrypted


EBS Lab Notes
========================
- Volumes exist on EBS
    * Virtual hard disk
- Snapshots are stored in S3
- Snapshots are a point in time copy of a volume
- Snapshots are incremental - this means that only the blocks that have
  changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3.
- To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you
  should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
    * You can take one when the instance is running as well.
- You can create AMI's from both volumes and snapshots
- You can change EBS volume sizes on the fly, including changing the size
  and storage type.
- Volumes will always be in the same availability zone a the ec2 instance.
- To move an ec2 volume from one AZ/Region to another, take a snap or image
  of it, then copy it in the new region
- Snapshots of encrypted volums are encrypted automatically
- Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted automatically
- You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted
    * These snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public

EFS Lab Notes
========================
- Amazon's elastic file system. Storage capacity is elastic and will grow
  and shrink automatically as you add and remove files.
- Supports Network File System version 4 (NSFv4) protocol
- You only pay for what you use
- Can scale up to petabytes
- Can support thousandes of concurrent NFS connections
- Data is stored across multiple AZ's within a region
- Read After Write Consistency

CLI Command Notes
========================
These are commands that you need to know for the test:
- aws ec2 describe-instances //Lists all instances
- aws ec2 describe-images //Lists all images that instances can be created from
- aws ec2 run-instances  //Starts an instance
