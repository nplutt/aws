General IAM notes for IAM
========================
- IAM is "regionless", one global region
- Can attach permissions to users as well aws groups
- Roles are a way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.
    * Permissions are applied through policies

Security Token Service (STS)
========================
Grants users limited and temporary access to AWS resources. Users can come from 3 resources:
- Federation (active directory)
    * Uses SAML
    * Grants temp access based off teh useres active directory credentials
    * Single sign on allows users to login to aws console without assigning iam creds
- Federation with mobile apps
    * Use facebook, google, amazon or other services to logon
- Cross account access
    * Lets users from one aws account access resources in another

Key Terms
========================
- Federation: Combininig or joining a list of users in one domain (sucha as iam) with 
              a list of users in another domain (sucha as active directory, facebook, etc.)
- Identity Broker: a service that allows you to take an identiy from point a to join it 
                  (federate it) to point b.
- Identity Store: Services like acrive directory, facebook, google, etc.
- Identities: a user of a service like facebook   

Questions:
========================
- Can you autheticate with an active directory?
    * Yes with saml
    * You always authenticate against the active directory first which gives you a token which,
      allows you to do things in the console.
